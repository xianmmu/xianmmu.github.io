        <p>Web browsers are software applications that enable users to access and interact with web pages on the internet. Different web browsers have different features, capabilities, and performance levels that may affect the user experience and satisfaction. </p>
        <p>In this document, we will explore the unique and special features of the web browsers <i>(Chrome, Opera GX, Edge, Firefox)</i> by using various sources of information such as official websites, reviews, benchmarks, and statistics to support our analysis.</p>
        <p>In addition, we'll also research about and test out the customizability and efficiency of the web browsers <i>(Chrome, Opera GX, Edge, Firefox)</i> by using various testing options provided by <a href="https://browserbench.org/">browserbench.org</a> to test different parts of the browsing experience, such as running heavy Javascript or graphics-intensive websites, as well as for consistency in variables. </p>
