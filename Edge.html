        <h3><p><span><strong>Customizability:</strong></span></h3> Edge is not as customizable as Firefox, but it still offers a number of options to change the look and feel of the browser. You can change the default search engine, homepage, add-ons, toolbars, and appearance of the browser. You can also create custom tabs and workspaces.</p>
        <h3><p><span><strong>Efficiency:</strong></span></h3>Edge is a very efficient browser. It uses less memory and CPU resources than Chrome, and it also has a number of features to help conserve battery life.</p>
        <h3><p><span><strong>Unique and Special Features:</strong></span></h3>
        <p><strong>Chromium-based:</strong> Edge is based on the Chromium open-source project, which means it shares many of the same features as Chrome. This makes it a good choice for users who are familiar with Chrome and want a similar experience.<br>
            <strong>Privacy features:</strong> Edge includes a number of privacy features, such as Intelligent Tracking Prevention <i>(ITP)</i> and a built-in ad blocker.<br>
            <strong>Integration with Microsoft 365:</strong> Edge is tightly integrated with Microsoft 365 apps, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. This makes it a good choice for users who need to work with these apps on a regular basis.<br>
            <strong>Reading mode:</strong> Edge's reading mode removes distractions (such as ads and sidebars), and makes it easier to focus on the text. This makes it a good choice for reading long articles or books.<br>
            <strong>Voice search:</strong> Edge supports voice search, so you can search the web without having to type anything.</p>
