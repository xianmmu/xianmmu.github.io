        <h3><p><span><strong>Customizability:</strong></span></h3> Firefox is one of the most customizable browsers available. You can change the default search engine, homepage, add-ons. You can also customize the toolbar and appearance of the browser. However, you cannot change the look and feel of the browser as much as you can with other browsers. 
        <h3><p><span><strong>Efficiency:</strong></span></h3>Firefox is a relatively efficient browser. It uses less memory and CPU resources than Chrome. This makes it a good choice for older computers or computers with limited resources.</p>
        <h3><p><span><strong>Unique and Special Features:</strong></span></h3>
        <p><strong>Privacy-focused:</strong> Firefox is known for its strong privacy features, such as tracking protection, private browsing mode, and Do Not Track <i>(DNT)</i> support.<br>
            <strong>Customizable:</strong> Firefox is highly customizable, with a wide range of add-ons and extensions available to change its appearance and functionality.<br>
            <strong>Synced tabs and history:</strong> Firefox allows you to sync your tabs and browsing history across multiple devices, so you can pick up where you left off no matter where you are.<br>
            <strong>Containers:</strong> Firefox Containers allow you to create separate browsing sessions for different purposes, such as work, school, or shopping. This helps to keep your online activity organized and secure.<br>
            <strong>Open source:</strong> Firefox is an open-source project, which means that its code is freely available for anyone to use and modify. This makes Firefox more transparent and accountable than closed-source browsers.</p>
